# export code

[Export code] It can export the selected layer in the Sketch design draft to the code of the selected language type, such as `GaiaX template`, `React`, `Rax`, `Vue`, `mini program`, etc. The code layout method is based on the box model layout (Flexbox) and the absolute layout (Absolute); for the node level, [Export Code] will be continuously optimized during the export process to make the level as few and reasonable as possible

### export code

step

1. First select the layer to be exported in the design draft

2. Open the [Export Code] function, a screenshot of the selected layer will be displayed in the preview area to confirm whether it is the layer you want to export, and then the language type of the code to be exported, currently including `GaiaX`, ` React`, `Rax`, `Vue`, `Applet` and other types, support multiple selection

3. Click [Export Code]

> If the exported language type is GaiaX, on the successful export page, you can directly import the GaiaX template into IDE to preview the editing. If you haven't downloaded IDE, please download it first

4. Products (take GaiaX as an example)

* GaiaX: code to select the type of language to export

## Principle

The goal of [Export Code] is to not require designers as much as possible, and it can be used in any design drafts of designers. In general, we recommend using [Export Code] to export reusable modules, and then build the system through the use of [Export Code]. to assemble pages from exported reusable templates

The overall process is as follows

## How to export custom language

If you want to export the code of a custom type language, the functions of [Preprocessing] and [Virtual Node Generator] can be reused without modification. In the [Label Generator] section, create a new class to inherit the base of sketch/src/code/core/Convertor class, and then return the information of the custom language type according to the protocol implementation

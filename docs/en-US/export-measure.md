It can automatically generate cut images when the designer does not have preset cuts, including two types. Dimensions `@2x` and `@3x`

The [preset] folder contains the cut images preset by the designer in the design draft, such as the Slice layer created by the Sketch software, or the [export item] is set on the relevant layer of the design draft.
